## 202 Class Demos, Spring 2025
In-class demos from my 11 am section of IGME 202 in the Spring 2025 semester.

Students are welcome to use this repo as a resource while they are working on their own exercises and projects.  
It contains up-to-date code from anything demonstrated during class sessions. 

Look closely through the code for extensive comments of what the code does and why it's coded that way.
